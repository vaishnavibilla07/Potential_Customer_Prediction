# Potential_Customer_Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a robust machine learning pipeline to predict the likelihood of converting incoming leads into paying customers for an EdTech startup named ExtraaLearn. Understanding and forecasting lead conversion rates is critical for optimizing marketing efforts, prioritizing sales outreach, and enhancing overall business growth.

By leveraging historical lead data, the project performs in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and key factors influencing conversions. The project involves extensive feature engineering to create meaningful predictors that improve model accuracy. Classification algorithms such as Decision Trees and Random Forests are implemented and fine-tuned to deliver reliable conversion predictions.

## Features and Capabilities
- **Data Exploration and Visualization:** Comprehensive analysis of lead attributes through statistical summaries and visualizations helps identify trends, correlations, and potential data quality issues.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creation of derived features and treatment of missing values to improve model performance.
- **Model Development:** Implementation of multiple classification algorithms with hyperparameter tuning to select the best-performing model.
- **Model Evaluation:** Use of metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to rigorously assess classification results.
- **Actionable Business Insights:** Interpretation of model outputs to identify key drivers of lead conversion, thereby assisting stakeholders in making informed decisions on targeting and resource allocation.
- **Reproducible Workflow:** All steps from data preprocessing to model training are encapsulated in clean, well-documented Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts, facilitating easy replication and extension.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python, chosen for its rich ecosystem in data science and machine learning.
- **Data Processing:** Pandas and NumPy for handling and manipulating datasets efficiently.
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating insightful charts and graphs.
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn for implementing and tuning classification models.
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook to combine code, documentation, and visual results interactively.
